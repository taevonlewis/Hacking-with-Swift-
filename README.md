## Overview

The **Swift Career Accelerator** is a comprehensive learning program designed by [Paul Hudson](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/272/swift-career-accelerator), aimed at helping developers at all stages of their career – from landing their first job to becoming a lead developer. It combines various learning resources, such as the 100 Days of SwiftUI, Ultimate Portfolio App, Take Home Test course, and in-depth topics like concurrency, Swift Package Manager, Big O notation, and advanced leadership skills.
